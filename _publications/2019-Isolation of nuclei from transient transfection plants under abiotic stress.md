excerpt: 'The isolation of nuclei is often the first step to study the processes such as protein–DNA regulation and interactions. Therefore, rapidly obtaining nuclei from woody plants with relatively high purity and minimal contamination is highly desirable. Many methods have been mainly employed in animal tissues because the plant cell wall represents an obstacle for the extraction of nuclei. The knowledge of nuclei of plant is less advanced than that of animals. Nevertheless, with the currently available techniques for nuclear isolation from whole plants, satisfactory yield of intact nuclei cannot be achieved because nuclei and protoplasts are more fragile during liquid nitrogen grinding and they have delicate plasma membranes that are suscep tible to bursting when subject to mechanical shock. Therefore, it is very important to develop new methods that have reduced damage to the nuclei. 
Here, we describe an efficient scheme for the preparation of pure and intact nuclei using protoplasts as a system. The basic technique applies to a variety of protoplast types and is expected to facilitate the experiments in many plants. It is based on co cultivation of total Betula platyphylla. Target gene is taken into B. platyphylla using Agrobacterium vector system. Transient gene expression system offers several advantages over stable expression. For instance, transient gene expression is simple and easy to perform by virtue of its time and labor efficiency [1]. The purpose of this protocol is not only to complete the stress but also to obtain high quality nuclei and nuclear DNA yields.'
