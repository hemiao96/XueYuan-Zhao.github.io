excerpt: 'The TCA cycle is a central metabolic hub necessary for ATP production and for providing precursors used in many biosynthetic pathways. The TCA cycle also plays a very important role in plants.Thus, dysregulation of the TCA cycle flux is frequently observed in plants.The identification of transgenic poplar in several enzymes of the TCA cycle in plants demonstrated a direct connection between this metabolic pathway and the influence to TCA cycle. In this review, the main genetic and non-genetic alterations of TCA cycle in poplar will be described'
