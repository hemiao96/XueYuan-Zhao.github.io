Research experience
======
* 2014-2018: Undergraduate
  * Northeast Forestry University（National Life Science and Technology Talent Training Base）
  * Achievements:Studied in Biotechnology (National Life Science and Technology Talent Training Base) of Northeast Forestry University, obtained a bachelor of science degree. 
  * Had a practice at the Institute of Nature and Ecology, Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences from 2015 to 2017 in weekends and vacations.
  * Published two papers : The Degree of Purification of mRNA Influences the Fragmentation for Construction Transcriptome Libraries of Populus , https://doi.org/10.5376/tgmb.2017.07.0001, The important role of the citric acid cycle in plants,  https://doi.org/10.5376/gab.2017.08.0004.
