Education
======
* B.S. in National Life Science and Technology Talent Training Base, Northeast Forestry University, 2014-2018
* M.S. in State Key Laboratory Of Tree Genetics And Breeding, Northeast Forestry University, 2019-

Research experience
======
* 2014-2018: Undergraduate
  * Northeast Forestry University (National Life Science and Technology Talent Training Base)
  * Achievements: Studied in Biotechnology (National Life Science and Technology Talent Training Base) of Northeast Forestry University, obtained a bachelor of science degree. 
  * Had a practice at the Institute of Nature and Ecology, Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences from 2015 to 2017 at weekends and vacations.
  * Published two papers: The Degree of Purification of mRNA Influences the Fragmentation for Construction Transcriptome Libraries of Populus, https://doi.org/10.5376/tgmb.2017.07.0001, The important role of the citric acid cycle in plants,  https://doi.org/10.5376/gab.2017.08.0004.

  * Supervisor: Dr.Lina Wang

* 2019-: master’s candidate (third year of three) Will graduate in 2022 summer
  * Northeast Forestry University (State Key Laboratory Of Tree Genetics And Breeding)
  * Achievements: During the first year of my master’s studies, I have published two SCI papers, one is Isolation of nuclei from transient transfection plants under abiotic stress, https://doi.org/10.1093/abbs/gmz079; the other is Overexpression of PtPEPCK1 gene promotes nitrogen metabolism in poplar, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-01042-4 (I am the second author of both papers, the first author and the corresponding author are my associate mentors). I did part of the writing of the two academic papers, all the picture making by Imager A2, all the data sorting, proofreading of the manuscript.

Additional Information:
======
  From 2015 to 2017, half of my undergraduate studies, I practised at The Institute of Nature and Ecology of Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences on weekends and vacations to identify, classify herbal plant samples, and prepare specimens of plants from Songnen Plain of China.

  Under the tutelage of Professor Yang Chuanping, an expert in white birch and red pine breeding, and fortunately, in The State Key Laboratory Of Tree Genetics And Breeding, the only national key laboratory in the field of forest tree breeding of China, I have learned a series of basic molecular biology operations such as gene cloning, vector construction, primer design, and other basic experimental operations like ChIP-seq, analysis of histone modifications.

  I am interested in using LSM800 laser confocal microscope and upright microscopes Axio Imager A2 to do fluorescent protein detection experiments such as image acquisition of fluorescence sample, FRAP, three-dimensional imaging of biological samples. I also do well in the chip-seq experimental procedure and simple bioinformatics analysis (IGV to align gene expression abundance). My current research directions are the transcriptional regulation of stress resistance genes and focus on the interaction between histones and transcription factors; some transcription factors co-localize in mitochondria to exert their effects.
