Personal Statement
======
As early as my undergraduate, I could see that transcription factors (TFs) regulate plant growth and metabolism. It led me to focus on the TFs regulation mechanism under adversity as I sought to apply my research in a more specific and digitally focused area. I published one article named The important role of the citric acid cycle in plants, using RNA-seq technology to analyze differential gene expression at the transcriptome level to study the TCA cycle. I also learned that purification of mRNA influences the fragmentation for construction transcription libraries of Populus.

With the professor of the Institute of Nature Resources and Ecology of Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences, I went to the SongNen Plain of china to collect samples and analyze the plant diversity from 2015 to 2017. The detailed understanding of "plant taxonomy" and "according to unique characteristics of things to make classification" influenced my following research, especially the deep knowledge of transcription factors. It classified that many proteins as transcription factors. However, they are also enzymes and even cofactors in histone modification.

During my master's degree at the Northeast Forestry University (State Key Laboratory Of Tree Genetics And Breeding), I had two primary focuses: tree genetics and molecular breeding and epigenetic modification of plant cells. I was interested in how particular gene and transcription factors react under abiotic stress, so I wrote my dissertation on how PtPEPCK1 promotes nitrogen metabolism in Poplar by over-expressing the PEPCK gene (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-01042-4) in 2019, the first year of my master's degree. My proposed research takes this theoretical research a step further, exploring the mode of transcription factor regulation under adversity conditions.

From then on, I used protoplasts to study plant cell genetics and published Isolation of nuclei from transient transfection plants under abiotic stress, https://doi.org/10.1093/abbs/gmz079. Since the plant protoplasts or callus are like animal cells because of almost no cell wall, I can use animal experiments methods to study them. （That is one reason that I have confidence in applying for this position. Because of my background in the cultivation of callus and protoplast, I possessed a perspective that my fellow empirically minded colleagues, with backgrounds in breeding at individual plant level, lacked. Using this unique perspective, I am now seeking to develop my dissertation research through a PhD project.

I conducted fieldwork in the LiangShui Nature reserve of china and gained direct experience collecting samples for Betula platyphylla growth under adversity conditions (e.g., salt stress, drought, cold) and analyzing them. I developed an aptitude for rapid measure research and enjoyed the challenge of comparing this population data across kinds of bioinformatics analysis methods. 

Research direction:
======
I have been concerning about the molecular mechanism and apparent mechanism of plant resistance, and using plant molecular breeding technology to breed new varieties. Recently, I discovered mitochondria play an interesting role in plant stress resistance, especially when some transcription factors are co-localized in mitochondria. The morphology and structure of mitochondria undergo drastic changes in adversity environments. Animal cells and organs may have similar phenomena when infected by viruses. We observed an interesting phenomenon. In extreme cases, mitochondria seem to power the nucleus，the most important part of the cell.

Because of this, I will conduct an in-depth exploration of future research from the following three aspects.

1. Mitochondria have abnormal performance under adversity pressure. As the most effective energy-supply organelle of cells, mitochondria play an important role. After all, the fundamental reason for plant cell death is that there is not enough energy to support normal physiological activities. Similarly, mitochondria have abnormal expressions in diseased animal cells. When the mitochondria cannot work well to provide the energy needed by the cell, the cell will die.

2. Next, I will use various microscopes (LSM, TEM, SEM...) to observe the morphology of mitochondria in plant cells under different pressures and the cell clusters of kinds of organs in various diseases， with the natural morphology.

3. Finally, I will use Chip-seq and RNA-seq to identify the different genes between diseased and normal cells under adversity. Then, I select typical genes and transfer a gene expressing co-localized transcription factors in mitochondria to generate over-expression samples to observe the state of plant cell mitochondria under different stresses and compare them with natural tissue cells. Differently, I will knock out genes expressing co-localize in mitochondria to observe the morphology of mitochondria in cell clusters in different organs of kinds of diseases and compare them with natural tissue cells. By using Pymol 2.0 to construct the three-dimensional protein structure of transcription factors, I will analyze the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein. And I will destroy a single domain or destroy many institutional domains to explore connections between many domains, research whether there are connections between multiple domains, and investigate mitochondrial abnormalities internal mechanism of behaviour under adversity conditions.
