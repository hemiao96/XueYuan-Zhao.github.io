======
I have been concerning about the molecular mechanism and apparent mechanism of plant resistance, and using plant molecular breeding technology to breed new varieties. Recently, I discovered mitochondria play an interesting role in plant stress resistance, especially when some transcription factors are co-localized in mitochondria. The morphology and structure of mitochondria undergo drastic changes in adversity environments. Animal cells and organs may have similar phenomena when infected by viruses. We observed an interesting phenomenon. In extreme cases, mitochondria seem to power the nucleus，the most important part of the cell.

Because of this, I will conduct an in-depth exploration of future research from the following three aspects.

1. Mitochondria have abnormal performance under adversity pressure. As the most effective energy-supply organelle of cells, mitochondria play an important role. After all, the fundamental reason for plant cell death is that there is not enough energy to support normal physiological activities. Similarly, mitochondria have abnormal expressions in diseased animal cells. When the mitochondria cannot work well to provide the energy needed by the cell, the cell will die.

2. Next, I will use various microscopes (LSM, TEM, SEM...) to observe the morphology of mitochondria in plant cells under different pressures and the cell clusters of kinds of organs in various diseases， with the natural morphology.

3. Finally, I will use Chip-seq and RNA-seq to identify the different genes between diseased and normal cells under adversity. Then, I select typical genes and transfer a gene expressing co-localized transcription factors in mitochondria to generate over-expression samples to observe the state of plant cell mitochondria under different stresses and compare them with natural tissue cells. Differently, I will knock out genes expressing co-localize in mitochondria to observe the morphology of mitochondria in cell clusters in different organs of kinds of diseases and compare them with natural tissue cells. By using Pymol 2.0 to construct the three-dimensional protein structure of transcription factors, I will analyze the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein. And I will destroy a single domain or destroy many institutional domains to explore connections between many domains, research whether there are connections between multiple domains, and investigate mitochondrial abnormalities internal mechanism of behaviour under adversity conditions.
